/* Best Practice:
   This is an example of the 'descendant selector' css rule.
   This ensures that the style is only applied to this widget and does not impact any other widget.
*/
.widget--widget-screen-recorder .specific-style-text {
  font-style: italic;
}

/* Another example which will impact all <span> elements within this widget only */
.widget--widget-screen-recorder span {
  margin-top: 20px;
